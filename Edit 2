\section{Lightsabers and Logic: The Final Permutation}

\subsection{Problem Statement}
Jedi Knight \textbf{Aria Solo} and Sith Lord \textbf{Darrus Vane} are locked in a final battle—not with lightsabers, but over a mysterious object known as the \textbf{Galactic Code Array}. This array is a scrambled, but unique sequence of numbers from 1 to $n$—neither sorted in increasing nor decreasing order, just a chaotic mess as if the galaxy itself conspired to challenge them.

Each element in the array is initially \textbf{red}, meaning it’s locked in place. On their turn, a player may choose one of the following actions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Turn one red element blue (i.e., unlock it).
  \item Rearrange all the blue elements in any way they want (but red ones remain fixed).
  \item Do nothing (pass the turn).
\end{itemize}

Players take turns, with \textbf{Aria (the Jedi) going first}. The game ends as soon as the array becomes sorted in a specific way:
\begin{itemize}
  \item If Aria arranges it into \texttt{[1, 2, 3, ..., n]} (i.e., in ascending order), she wins.
  \item If Darrus makes it \texttt{[n, n-1, ..., 1]} (i.e., in descending order), he wins.
  \item If neither player succeeds within a reasonable number of turns, the battle ends in a \textbf{Tie}.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Hint:} Rearranging blue elements is only useful if it results in an immediate win, because the opponent can undo any arrangement on their next turn.

\subsection{Your Mission}

Given several starting configurations of the Galactic Code Array, your task is to predict the final outcome of the game—\texttt{First}, \texttt{Second}, or \texttt{Tie}—assuming both Jedi Aria and Sith Lord Darrus play as intelligently and strategically as possible.

You may either:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Write a clear step-by-step explanation (an algorithm), \textbf{or}
  \item Submit a well-commented implementation in \texttt{C}, \texttt{C++}, or \texttt{Python}.
\end{itemize}

In either case, please address the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the \textbf{optimal strategy} for both players?  
        \textit{(Optimal play means playing perfectly, making no mistakes.)}
  \item Under what conditions does a player have a \textbf{winning strategy}?  
        \textit{(A winning strategy guarantees a win, no matter what the opponent does.)}
  \item Clearly explain that winning strategy.
  \item Why can’t either player deviate from that strategy and expect to do better?  
        \textit{(This refers to the idea of a \textbf{dominant strategy}, one that’s always best regardless of the opponent’s move.)}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Your solution will be tested on multiple configurations. The input format is:

\begin{itemize}
  \item An integer \texttt{t} — the number of test cases.
  \item For each test case:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item An integer \texttt{n} — the size of the array.
      \item A permutation of numbers \texttt{1} to \texttt{n}, which is neither sorted in ascending nor descending order.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The output should be:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{"Win"} if Aria wins,
  \item \texttt{"Lose"} if Darrus wins,
  \item \texttt{"Tie"} if the game is drawn.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Example}

\textbf{Input:}
\begin{verbatim}
2
4
3 1 4 2
5
2 5 1 4 3
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Output:}
\begin{verbatim}
Win
Tie
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Grading Policy}

The task will be graded out of 100 points. You may choose to write either a clear, step-by-step solution or submit a well-commented code implementation—there is \textbf{no need to do both}. If done both , the points will be calculated separately and marks will be awarded on the best solution.

\begin{itemize}
  \item If submitting code:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Ensure it passes all test cases.
      \item Include meaningful comments to explain your logic.
      \item If your code doesn’t pass all cases, partial marks will be awarded based on number of test cases it passed and comments provided on the code
    \end{itemize}
  \item If writing a solution:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Clearly outline both players’ strategies.
      \item Explain winning conditions and when a forced tie occurs.
      \item Even if your solution fails to cover all possible scenarios and is partially correct marks will be given upon your understanding of the question and the explanation provided/
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\noindent
In case multiple candidates score equally, preference will be given based on their stated project preferences.\\

\noindent
\textbf{May the force be with you.}
